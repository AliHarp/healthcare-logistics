    "## **Case study**: An applied facility location problem: sexual clinics in Hampshire, UK\n",
    "\n",
    "The data you will use in the exercises in this computer lab is taken from a real facility location study conducted in Hampshire.  The data science team worked with commissioners, a public health team, and a community NHS trust in Hampshire that were reviewing the provision of sexual health clinics across the region.  The data science 'customers' had a number of concerns about the current provision of sexual health care.  One of these was the sustainability of the adult service across 28 locations.  There was a growing concern that care varied and the data scientists were asked to identify promising configurations that preserved fair access for patients.\n",
    "\n",
    "**By the end of this lab you will have learnt how to:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* represent a facility location problem in a general format suitable for algorithmic solution\n",
    "* solve the p-median facility location problem using a brute force approach\n",
    "* solve a larger p-median problem by applying an evolutionary optimisation approach\n",
    "* obtain a good solution to large instances of the p-median problem by applying a Genetic Algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Please use the conda environment `hds_logistics` when running this workbook.  You will also need to run this workbook in the same directory as `metapy`.  This is a small python package that contains the evolutionary and genetic algorithm code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first part of the notebook will walk you through the basics of representing a solution, generating random solutions, and evaluating a solution.  You will then be asked to complete a number of exercises using these fundamentals to locate facilties in partial and full instances of the case study."
